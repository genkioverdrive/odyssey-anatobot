# odyssey-anatobot

Our project aims at bringing about a phenomenol change in the lives of people all around the world in the form of nanobots.
Our anatobot is a type of nanobot made of biodegradable materials which is not harmful in any way to the patient's immune system and helps in the process of microscopic chemotherapy in the most effective way. 
Anatobots can also analyse the human anatomy by detecting the nerve impulses which are carried around by the dendrites, sort of like neural networks.
So, Team SAMBHAV presents "THE ANATOBOT-INTO THE UNKNOWN".
